# FlowController
FlowController is a demonstration project that illustrates a common implementation of the Coordinator pattern using a MainCoordinator in a Swift-based iOS application. The goal of this project is to exhibit a clean separation of concerns and a structured navigation flow, thereby promoting a more organized and maintainable codebase.

# Features
A MainCoordinator class that centralizes navigation logic, keeping it separate from view controllers.
Multiple view controllers (ViewControllerA, ViewControllerB, ViewControllerC, ViewControllerD, and ViewControllerE) demonstrating different navigation paths managed by the MainCoordinator.
A demonstration of passing data from one view controller to another using the Coordinator pattern.

# Benefits and Trade-offs
Pro: Provides a clear separation of concerns by moving navigation logic out of view controllers, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.✅
Pro: Helps manage dependencies and share common data across the app, which can be beneficial in large projects.✅
Pro: Encourages a hierarchical and composable coordination approach which can be nested or reused across different parts of the app.✅
Con: May introduce more complexity to the project due to the addition of extra layers of abstraction.❌

# Architecture
The project is structured following the Coordinator pattern, with a main coordinator (MainCoordinator) handling navigation between multiple view controllers.

Coordinator Protocol: Defines the basic structure and functionality of a coordinator.
MainCoordinator: A class that implements the Coordinator protocol, managing the navigation logic throughout the app.
View Controllers: Various view controllers demonstrating different navigational paths orchestrated by the MainCoordinator.
