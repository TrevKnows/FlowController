# FlowController
FlowController is a demonstration project that illustrates a common implementation of the Coordinator pattern using a MainCoordinator in a Swift-based iOS application. The goal of this project is to exhibit a clean separation of concerns and a structured navigation flow, thereby promoting a more organized and maintainable codebase.
